- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m EternalFlam3-14
I'm a college student currently working towards a career in plant genetics. I'm an amateur coding hobbyist learning how to code C++ with my current project.

Projects:
- GeneProject (name isn't a focus, subject to change) 
  - An artificial selection simulator with a focus on the genetic perspective. Will simulate crossing over of chromosomes, multiple gene expression, gene regulation, and is currently looking at being built using neural networks for genome-phenome mapping. Is my first and biggest venture into C++ programming.
