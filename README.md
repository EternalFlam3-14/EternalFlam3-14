- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m EternalFlam3-14
I'm a college student currently working towards a career in plant genetics. I'm an amateur coding hobbyist learning how to code C++ with my current project.

Projects:
- GeneProject (name isn't a focus, subject to change) 
  - An expandable program that can generate a 34 allele genome, read the generated sequence and output the phenotype. This is my main project, with many more features planned
